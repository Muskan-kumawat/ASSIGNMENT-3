# ASSIGNMENT-3

## Task 1: Factorial Calculation
This script defines a function `factorial(n)` which calculates the factorial of a number using iteration. It demonstrates the concept of defining and calling user-defined functions.

**Example:**  
Input: 5  
Output: The factorial of 5 is 120.

## Task 2: Math Module Operations
This script uses Python's `math` module to perform three operations on user input:
- Square Root
- Natural Logarithm (base e)
- Sine (in radians)

**Example:**  
Input: 25  
Output:  
- Square root of 25 is 5.0  
- Natural log of 25 is 3.218...  
- Sine of 25 radians is -0.132...
